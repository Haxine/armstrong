Armstrong
=========
Armstrong is an open-source publishing system designed for news organizations
that gives your team the technology edge it needs to report in a media-rich
environment.

This package is a meta package that loads all of the various components of
Armstrong as independent packages.  Installing this package is the easiest way
to get the full distribution of Armstrong, but is not required to use the
various components of Armstrong.

For the latest released version of Armstrong, use `pip`_ to install it from
`PyPI`_ like this::

Note that PyPI only has official releases.  At this point in time there are no
official releases.

State of Project
